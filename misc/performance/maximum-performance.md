Benchmarking The Maximum Possible Peformance
============================================
Using the script below, it's possible to see how fast a single threaded frame grabbing program can run on an ARM board.
Running without the `-p` flag to enable OpenCV frame decoding, you should see the camera provide frames at about 30 FPS. With the `-p` flag, it'll show the board's maximum capability for grabbing and decompressing frames using OpenCV. It's possible to go faster than this with multi-threading.

Compilation
-----------
Compile the code from [framegrabberCV][http://blog.lemoneerlabs.com/3rdParty/Darling_BBB_30fps_DRAFT.html].

```
gcc -o framegrabberCV framegrabberCV.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
```

Setup
-----
Optionally set the performance governor for each of these tests to forgo the effect of CPU scaling:
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance
