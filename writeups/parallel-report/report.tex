\title{Parallelised Pose Estimation for Automated Landing}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Current approaches for automated landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are
based on GPS localization, which we show is quite inaccurate. We optimise a previously implemented computer vision based pose estimation algorithm to run in real time on a low cost open source embedded computer.

    Architecture of our automated landing system. We use inexpensive
    off-the-shelf hardware. The laptop and remote control are for
    monitoring and emergency takeover by a human pilot. All the
    computation is performed onboard the UAV.
