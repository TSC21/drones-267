\section*{Implementation Plan}

We plan to:
\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Outline our vision approach.} Review the literature on vision-based
autonomous landing, and choose an approach to implement. Build a prototype
landing station with markers.

\item {\bf Implement vision-based pose estimation.} Write the code that locates
the landing station and estimates the quadcopter's pose with respect to it.
Test this in a lab setting, where we control the camera's position manually.

\item {\bf Couple pose estimation and control.} Make the quadcopter land
autonomously based on real-time vision-based pose estimates. Characterize the
error as before. If our project is successful, this should improve
significantly over the vision-less baseline.

\end{enumerate}
