Had to add myself to the `video` group.

Camera doesn't work if plugged in directly, has to be plugged in via powered
hub.

CaptureFPS (capturing frames and doing nothing with them) gives me about 17
FPS. Top shows full CPU usage while CaptureFPS is running.

(In contrast, on my laptop, CaptureFPS gets 28 FPS, but does not use full CPU.)
