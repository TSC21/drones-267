Our Beaglebone is running [this image][1], which uses kernel 3.8.13.


## Devices we need to connect to the Beaglebone:

`lsusb` shows device IDs and names, `lsusb -v` shows MaxPower and other stuff.

- webcam: TODO
- wifi dongle: ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter
  (MaxPower: 450mA)
- APM: TODO
- (debug only) keyboard: (various)


## Hub 1: ID 05e3:0606 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB 2.0 Hub / D-Link DUB-H4 USB 2.0 Hub

Not a powered hub. Got some instability issues with it.
Did not investigate in detail, since it probably won't
be enough to power 3 devices.


## Hub 2: ID 0409:005a NEC Corp. HighSpeed Hub

("Arkview Aquagate 7 port hi performance hub")

Powered hub. If we boot the Beaglebone with the hub unplugged, we can plug it
in and unplug it repeatedly, and the Beaglebone recognizes it every time. But
if we boot the Beaglebone with the hub plugged in, it won't recognize it (and
the blue lights on the hub don't turn on). In that case, the Beaglebone won't
recognize any USB devices. E.g. if we unplug the hub and plug in a simple
keyboard, it still doesn't get recognized. (Connected via ethernet to look at
logs -- nothing appears in syslog when plugging / unplugging the hub or any
other USB device.)

With a normal boot (no USB hub connected), tried random pieces of code
(resetusb, usbreset) to reset the USB port. These either had no effect,
or made the Beaglebone lock up (no heartbeat).

Verified that the Beaglebone boots fine with only a USB keyboard plugged in, or
with only the wifi dongle plugged in. So the problem does not happen with every
USB device, but happens specifically with this hub.

Tried adding `noapic` to `optargs` in `/boot/uboot/uEnv.txt` (check params of
currently running kernel with `dmesg |grep 'Kernel command line'`). No effect.

Tried doing `lsusb -v` when booted with dead USB. This shows some usb-related
messages in syslog, but does not fix the problem.

Tried disabling autosuspend by adding `usbcore.autosuspend=-1` to `optargs` in
`/boot/uboot/uEnv.txt` and creating a file
`/etc/modprobe.d/disable-usb-autosuspend.conf` with `options usbcore
autosuspend=-1` as content. No effect.

Found one method to unbrick the USB port when booting with dead USB:
1) unplug hub
2) run:
    ```
    echo '0' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/authorized
    sleep 2
    echo '1' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/authorized
    sleep 2
    echo 'on' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/power/control
    ```
3) plug hub again and it works!

If I keep the hub plugged in while doing the above, the hub still doesn't work.
If I unplug the hub and plug it back in, it still doesn't work. Seems like the
reset has to be done with the hub unplugged. (No difference in the logs when
doing the reset above with the hub plugged or unplugged.)

Tried unbinding / rebinding the device to the driver (didn't help):
```
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ echo "usb1" |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ echo "usb1" |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind
```

TODO:
- people are also saying you should ground the Beaglebone properly...
  "You need to make sure that the HUB power is grounded and it has the same
  ground as the power as the BeagleBone Black."
- look into `hub-ctrl.c`


## Hub 3: ID 0409:005a NEC Corp. HighSpeed Hub

(A different one from Rosewill, http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00552PMN8/)

Worked flawlessly the first time...
