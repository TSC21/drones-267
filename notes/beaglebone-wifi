Ad-hoc wifi did not work with the adafruit adapter. Worked fine with the wi-pi one.

Better to have eth0 turned off to avoid confusion.

On the beaglebone, set up `/etc/network/interfaces` like this:

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# auto eth0
# iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
   wireless-mode ad-hoc
   wireless-channel 11
   wireless-essid beagle-ad-hoc
   wireless-key 1122334455
   address 192.168.1.1
   netmask 255.255.255.0
```

On the laptop, connect to the network that the beaglebone broadcasts. Set IP to
192.168.1.2. Now able to SSH between the two.
