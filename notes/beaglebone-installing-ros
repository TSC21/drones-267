Note ROS on ubuntu-arm is marked "experimental". In particular, they say
there's no LISP interpreter for arm yet, and many packages don't compile on arm
yet...

Followed [this][1], replacing raring with precise everywhere. Turns out ROS
hydro (latest ATM) isn't available for precise. Installing groovy (previous
version) instead.

Installing the most bare-bones ROS variant, `ros-hydro-ros-base`. This still
pulls in ~400MB of stuff (c++ compilers and libs, python, etc).
