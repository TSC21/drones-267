## Checklist for testing Return-to-Launch mode:

1. Check battery level.

1. Make sure copter is flat while calibrating sensors.
   If it's tilted, the calibration will be off.

1. Calibrate barometer before a flight. Then fly it in stabilize mode
   for a while and verify that the altitude readings make sense.

1. Make sure GPS lock is acquired before lift-off.
   (Otherwise, if it acquires the GPS lock in the air,
   it will think that point is "home", and try to land there.)

1. Wait 30sec after GPS lock acquired, so that the GPS location
   estimate has time to settle.


## Other things to do before trusting RTL:

1. Verify accuracy of altitude estimates based on barometer.
   (Normally it uses barometer when higher than 20 feet, and sonar below that.)
   (One guy mentioned that the foam covering the barometer was a problem.)
