Our Beaglebone is running [this image][1], which uses kernel 3.8.13.


## Devices we need to connect to the Beaglebone:

`lsusb` shows device IDs and names, `lsusb -v` shows MaxPower and other stuff.

- webcam: TODO
- wifi dongle: ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter
  (MaxPower: 450mA)
- APM: TODO
- (debug only) keyboard: (various)


## Hub 1: ID 05e3:0606 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB 2.0 Hub / D-Link DUB-H4 USB 2.0 Hub

Not a powered hub. Got some instability issues with it.
Did not investigate in detail, since it probably won't
be enough to power 3 devices.


## Hub 2: ID 0409:005a NEC Corp. HighSpeed Hub

Powered hub. If we boot the Beaglebone with the hub unplugged, we can plug it
in and out repeatedly, and the Beaglebone recognizes it every time. But if we
boot the Beaglebone with the hub plugged in, it won't recognize it (and the
blue lights on the hub don't turn on). In that case, the Beaglebone won't
recognize any USB devices. E.g. if we plug the hub out and plug in a simple
keyboard, it still doesn't get recognized. (Hard to interact with the
Beaglebone in this case, so hard to debug. But it seems that its USB host port
is completely dead.)

With a normal boot (no USB hub connected), tried random pieces of code
(resetusb, usbreset) to reset the USB port. These either had no effect,
or made the Beaglebone lock up (no heartbeat).

Verified that the Beaglebone boots fine with only a USB keyboard plugged in, or
with only the wifi dongle plugged in. So the problem does not happen with every
USB device, but happens specifically with this hub.

TODO:
- ssh into the Beaglebone using ethernet, and see what the logs say when USB
  seems dead
- one guy suggested disabling USB suspend:
    juanjo@boil:~$ zcat /proc/config.gz |grep USB_SUSPEND
    # CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND is not set
- people are also saying you should ground the Beaglebone properly...
  "You need to make sure that the HUB power is grounded and it has the same
  ground as the power as the BeagleBone Black."
- see suggestions in [this thread][2]
