\title{Accurate Vision-Based Landing For Multicopter UAVs}

\maketitle
We planned to do the following steps for the milestone:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Validate our architecture.} Assemble all the components of our
system, and make sure there are no surprises (insufficient radio range,
insufficient on-board compute power, difficulties controlling the autopilot
from software, etc).

\item {\bf Characterize our sensing error.} Make the quadcopter land
autonomously based on its internal pose estimate (GPS, IMU, barometer).
Characterize the error in terms of displacement from the desired landing
location on the ground, and the altitude at which the motors are powered off.
This gives us a baseline that we are trying to improve upon by adding vision.

\item {\bf Outline our vision approach.} Review the literature on vision-based
autonomous landing, and choose an approach to implement. Build a prototype
landing station with markers.

\end{enumerate}

This document describes our progress towards these goals.
